Slimjet
=======

Why I like this browser which coming from the WindowsÂ® world carries a super restrictive "Freeware" license:

- By default uses *half* the memory Chromium/Google Chrome need to display the same web sites;
- Has as well-thought panel of handy options (like "Restore last session", unload unused tabs, a Tasks manager or a handy choice of facilities/privacy options)

This is an updated PKGBUILD for the latest (per my availabilities) Slimjet version, based on raininja's AUR PKGBUILD.
