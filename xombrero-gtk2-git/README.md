xombrero-gtk2
===============

xombrero is an incredibly light and efficient browser.

The graph below shows you CPU, RAM usage, load average... and *the time* needed to load ten pages for xombrero and seven other browsers on an Atom N450 netbook.

This is a Gtk2 build for Arch linux, as it gives more real estate room and is a bit lighter on resources than the default Gtk3 build (does depends on *webkitgtk2* not *webkitgtk*/*gtk3*).
Forked from [epitron's PKGBUILD](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xombrero-git/)

Architectures: x86 and x86_64 (Maybe it can build on ARM as well? would be nice).
